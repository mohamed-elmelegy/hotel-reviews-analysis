A little confusing getting there if your walking (very little to no street signs) but ultimately a call to the BB saved me from wondering around.

This is not the Marriot but it is a nice place to rest after a long day on a plane. The innkeeper (Byron) was very nice and helpful. I didn't stay for the breakfast opting for a bowl of cereal instead due to a busy schedule. Overall a good BB experience and I would definitely come back if I'm ever in the area. Thank you.

In addition, can you imagine a BB not offering orange juice for breakfast The worst part, the price is not cheaper than the other BB close by, which offers much better breakfast, service and room, and in which you do need to wait to use the bathroom.

       "  'reviews.text': 'I stayed in the BB in Cambridge from 9-14 August 2014 when I attended a course at Harvard. The biggest asset of this BB is the location: it is 10-min. walk to the Harvard Yard. The breakfast was also very good (crepes or flapjacks with blueberries), but could be more varied. Byron, the live-in manager was very helpful and entertaining. I booked this BB based on the very positive reviews, but the standard has obviously dropped since they were written. Having said that, the owners have been working on bringing it back to standard, especially the cleanliness. However, more work is needed to make it a competitive BB, suitable to the needs of business travellers or visitors to Harvard or MIT. It was also too expensive for what it offered (188 a night!) The bathroom is shared! If you are on a tight schedule you will need to book the shower. We had 5 people competing for the shower, but the biggest problem was the toilet (no guest WC). The back porch needs a lot of work before it can be enjoyed by the guests, but they do have a selection of books and Byron is a walking encyclopaedia of knowledge about Cambridge and Boston. Parking: you will need a lot of luck or a lot of patience! The apartment is on the third floor, so ask Byron for help with your luggage. Bottom line: Great location, and great potential. With honest work this can be a great place to stay for visitors to Harvard or MIT. I hope the owners will turn this BB around to deserve great reviews again.',\n",
